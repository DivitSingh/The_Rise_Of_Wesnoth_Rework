# Main Goals
- Remove fluff/non-scenarios to make the campaign more engaging and approachable.
- Adjust dialogue a bit so the characters act more appropriately to their roles but maintain their personalities and backgrounds.

## Scenario Outline
### A Summer of Storms
Stays as is for the most part.
### The Fall + A Harrowing Escape (Merged)
Very similar themes as both involve escaping the orcs. The former is a lot more interesting though due to having 2 stronger enemies pressing from the north and requiring one leader to be defeated in the east.
### Swamps of Esten / Midlands (Removed)
This isn’t really a choice since the former is easier and also more rewarding than the latter. We could cut these as we already fight Orcs/Undead for the majority of the campaign.
I also find it odd that Minister Edren is living alone right in the middle of a swamp with dangerous undead and cultists crawling about.
### The Oldwood
Important to lore, and we can have Minister Edren living here instead, as one of the few human ‘tree-friends’ and can also be the reason why the Wose are not immediately hostile to Haldric (apart from needing assistance). Perhaps a potential connection between Edren and Eldaric (Haldric’s father)?
### Temple in the Deep (Removed)
It feels odd to have 1 scenario for the Book and 1 for the Ruby. Might be better if the Wose hand over the Ruby due to Edren’s influence and the fact that Haldric saved them. Lich-Lord Lenvan doesn’t really do much other than being a generic ‘lich in a cave’.
### Clearwater Port (Removed)
See ‘A Final Spring’.
### Fallen Lich Point + Sewer of Southbay (Merged)
Instead of having Orcs attack us yet again in ‘Fallen Lich Point’, why not have the 2 Arch Mages from ‘Sewer of Southbay’ be part of the Wesfolk faction still allied with Jevyan, attacking us with a mix of Loyalists and Outlaws as we attempt to un-petrify Lich-Lord Caror and get the book about the Ruby of Fire?
This way, both scenarios can be combined into one, while also expanding on Wesfolk politics- it makes sense that not every Wesfolk would be like Jessene and some may want to join Jevyan even he is untrustworthy.
### A Final Spring
It feels odd to me that Clearwater Port is a clear escape from the orcs, while a Final Spring, which should have Haldric overwhelmed by the enemy, is actually a defeating all enemy leaders’ scenario. Instead, we utilize the ideas of ‘Clearwater Port’, i.e., survive till a boat arrives, here.
We can have Commander Aethyr make his appearance alongside King Addroran. See Characterization.
### Peoples in Decline
Kept mostly as is, but improved Drake dialogue and personality. Currently, they behave like stupid fools and use Saurian speech instead of the poem-like Drake speech from ‘Winds of Fate’. We need this scenario since it relates to WoF.
### A Rough Landing (Removed)
Another defeating enemy leader scenario that does not add to plot and just buffs the player’s recall list even more.
### A New Land (Removed)
This is really a non-scenario. All you do is survive for a few turns, and then when a kill occurs, the scenario ends.
### The Dragon
One of the more meaningful Ka’lian quests, probably stays a lot like it is currently.
### Lizard Beach (Removed)
Fighting Saurians yet again with no real plot or lore relevance.
### The Troll Hole
Stays mostly the same. Relevant to plot since this is where Jessene hides the Ruby of Fire.
### Cursed Isle
Currently has a very weak plot. I am thinking we involve Jevyan’s Familiar in this scenario, since it has a very diminished role. It could serve as a potential miniboss battle in the island, replacing the Vampire Lady that has little to no lore relevance and a rather forgettable character.
### The Vanguard + Return of the Fleet (Merged)
Both scenarios involve fighting Orcs and Undead- Jevyan’s army. We can have only one of the two since they are essentially doing the same thing.
### Rise of Wesnoth
A decent finale but can be improved. One suggestion would be to replace the Orcish Warlord in the sea with a Naga Myrmidon since the Orc Warlord only recruits Nagas and Vampire Bats.

## Characterization
### Orcs
I feel the orcs are poorly characterized as ‘dumb fools’, being completely one-dimensional. They don’t need to be too deep, but some slightly more ‘intelligent’ dialogue would be an improvement. Some orcs might even consider that Jevyan is going to betray them eventually, whether or not they act on it is a separate matter.
### Drakes
They will behave more intelligently and use drake-speech as in WoF.
### Protagonists
The main cast has fairly fleshed-out personalities, so I won’t change too much, except the use of excessive slang in some situations if it comes up. I mentioned earlier about giving Aethry and Addroran an interesting dynamic since Addroran would be coping with the loss of both of his sons and might see an ideal son-like figure in the responsible and honorable Aethyr.
