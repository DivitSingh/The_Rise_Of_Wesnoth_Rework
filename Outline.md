# Main Goals
- Remove repetitive scenarios and non-scenarios to make the campaign more engaging and approachable.
- Adjust dialogue to meet the lore set by other mainline campaigns.

# Outline
### A Summer of Storms
Stays as is for the most part.
### The Fall + A Harrowing Escape (Merged)
Haldric must flee Stormvale as he is assailed by the Orcish hordes. He shall choose whether or not to ally with the Wesfolk as he makes his way through a narrow valley.
### Swamps of Esten / Midlands (Improved)
- 'Swamps of Esten': Defeat the monsters inhabiting the swamp to clear the path to the Oldwood. Sir Ruddry does not join Haldric here.
- 'Midlands': Defeat the Wesfolk allied with Jevyan that occupy the plains. Sir Ladoc, a loyal Dragoon equipped with an Arcane Amulet, joins Haldric's team after the battle is completed.
### The Oldwood (Cutscene)
Haldric meets the Wose of the woods. They are joined by Rogue Magi that formerly served Lich-Lord Jevyan.
The battle with Orcs is removed. This is purely a cutscene now.
### Temple in the Deep (Improved)
Waves of Undead summoned by the weakened Lich-Lord Lenvan (due to Ruby influence) assail Haldric's forces. Some puzzles must be solved, and the lich defeated, in order to obtain the Ruby of Fire.
### Clearwater Port (Changed)
Assist Aethyr in defeating a Naga raiding party. The latter attempt to damage the port. Sir Ruddry, a loyal Knight, joins Haldric's team after the battle is completed.
### Fallen Lich Point + Sewer of Southbay (Merged)
The 2 Arch Mages from ‘Sewer of Southbay’ are part of the Wesfolk faction still allied with Jevyan, utlizing Loyalist and Outlaw units. Haldric's team must un-petrify Lich-Lord Caror and obtain the Wesfolk Grimoire.
### A Final Spring (Changed)
Resist the enemy until the fleet is ready to depart. Commander Aethyr makes his appearance alongside King Addroran.
### Peoples in Decline (Improved)
Drake dialogue and personality corresponds to WoF lore.
### A Rough Landing (Removed)
Does not add to plot and has repetitive objectives.
### A New Land (Cutscene)
No real mechanics. This is purely a cutscene now.
### The Dragon (Same)
### Lizard Beach (Removed)
Fighting Saurians with no plot or lore relevance.
### The Troll Hole (Same)
### Cursed Isle (Improved)
Jevyan's Familiar is summoning Undead in the Isle and attempting to raise a forward party in order to assist its master. Defeat the creature before it is able to achieve its goal.
### The Vanguard + Return of the Fleet (Removed)
Both scenarios are similar to 'Rise of Wesnoth'. The fleet's return will be incorporated in the finale to add more impact story-wise to that scenario.
### Rise of Wesnoth (Improved)
Haldric's fleet makes its return. The south-west Orcish Warlord is changed to a Naga Myrmidon. The west Orcish Warlord is changed to a Saurian Prophet.
